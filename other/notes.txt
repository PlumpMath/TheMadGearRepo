We see a special alert of the big screen guy talking about the kid napping of Mayor Blopp had been kid napped. "What with Jonald Bloop's tough on crime attitude, there is little doubt that one of Turbo City's many gangs is behind it."


Cut to Mad Gear watching the report at their hideout. They complain about it interrupting their show. There's a knock at the door, it's one of the prison guard guys
-Hey gang, we're on TV!
-We've got a warrant for the arrest of the Mad Gear Gang of Tough Guys.
-We shortened it to The Mad Gear.
-Surrender quietly, or else..
-I hope that's a water gun.

**screen shakes, Entire HQ is lifted off ground by a helicopter


Okay, so gang escapes prison 
- We've got to find the mayor!
- That dang fool? I say let 'em stay kidnapped.
- But we've got to clear our good name.
- We ain't got one of those.
- Someone got us locked up. I'd love to return the favor.
- Well let's think : who's always kidnapping authority figures?
- Ninjas?
- Bingo!

Gang defeats ninjas

- What is it with you guys? You've ruined my inner chi!
-Tell us where the mayor is, ninja.
-mayor? I heard the Creepy Crew had him.
-The creepy crew? Rex Skeleton's old gang?
- They're dead to me. *pause* or undead to me.
- Well let's go ask 'em with our fists.

Alright - creepy crew boss defeated 
- tell us what you know
- I heard the mayor's been stashed away real good, something about a - 
*dagger flies through window and kills Death
- Death... is Dead!
- *mad gear finds shoe prints outside*
- hi-heeled boots. Very fancy. 
- sounds like... 
- (close-up) THE WHIG PARTY

Whig boss defeated
- You brutes! This damage is irreparable!
- We'll do worse if you don't start talkin, you powdery freak
- Haha cough cough hahaha fools. Your mayor is in another hideout. A lunar hideout!
- Lunar? The moon getaway summer camp?
- It's that cronie of his, Waltzer. He's responsible. 
- Sooooo can we take your rocket?
- Oh yeah sure, just give it some gas when you start it up

*mad gear flies to the moon*

Just before final battle:
Waltzer: the Mad Gear!
- didn't expect to see us, did you?
- actually, this is exactly what I expected.
- What do you mean?
- I'll take credit for cleaning up the streets!They'll make me the next mayor of Turbo City, haha!
-I'll have complete control. No one will lift a finger to oppose me!
- oh there'll be some fingers all right. 
-but they'll be in fist form!
-knuckle sandwiches with all the fixins!
-I'm afraid you'll need more than bare knuckles for this brawl, punks!


- Mayor Bloop, its all over. We can go hom now.
- But I can't leave! I haven't finished playing The Mad Gear.
- You have to go back and run Turbo City.
- But I hate being the Mayor. I just want to play video games. I quit!
**back at the hideout**
Breaking news! Mayor Bloop resigned from office. Turbo city is voting on a new mayor. The results are in.

Mayor Ninja appears
- Now the ninja is mayor? Good grief.
- How could you, Turbo City?
- We don't typically get along with mayors anyway.
*Ninja speaks*
-Turbo city will be great
Mayor Ninja slashes his sword
-or face the consequences..
-Maybe one of us should run for mayor.
-Not a chance

THE END

*in blanket fort*
- Mayor Bloop, its over. We can go home now.
-But Mr Waltzer said we could do go-carts after we meet the moon dignitaries!
- We... sent Mr waltzer to a farm.
- In space.
- A space farm ?
- ...yep.
-Neat! Can I go?
-Hopefully one day!
*back home, youngish woman*
-The mayoral office thanks you again, Mad Gear. Who'd have thought the baddest gang in town could have pulled this off?
- Well WE DID!
- You'll be glad to know we've found incriminating evidence against Mayor Bloop's campaign, particularly chairman waltzer's illegal funding of the mayoral race. There will be a recall election in the next month. Maybe the citizens will elect someone a bit more qualified this time around ...
- We won't get our hopes up
- We don't typically get along with mayors anyway
- Well, when the time comes, we'll be looking for a clean slate when it comes to security detail. Would the Mad Gear would be interested?
-Not a chance
-But... we may know some interested parties

***Ninja Mayor***
